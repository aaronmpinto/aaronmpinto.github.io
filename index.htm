                  the effectiveness of patient care for the entire province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, by managing a multi-year assessment and
                  transition of over $21M in technical assets from various Health Authorities to the 
                  BC Clinical and Support Services Society, directly under the Ministry of Health.</p><p>I authored several business cases to acquire funding and support and
                  managed several hundred people via over 20 leadership-level working groups across the province through the transition. </p>

                <div class="intro">
                  <p> As another example of complex political manoeuvring, aiming to improve support for substance users within the province, I managed 
                    the physical merger of the BC Mental Health and Substance Use 
                    Services group and the BC Corrections Mental Health group.</p><p>As these groups existed as two separate government entities
                    within the province, political finesse was needed to ensure that the site infrastructure for the merged group would 
                    effectively satisfy and support the executive leadership consolidation such that patient care would benefit overall.<p>
                    An additional key challenge in this project specifically was the modification of a culturally
                    important site such that site readiness was completed without marked damage to the core infrastructure itself.

                  <p> This project is featured to capture my role in the build of an entire tower within a hospital site. 
                    In this project, with the focus of providing the best treatment and support for pre- and post-natal women, I managed the full 
                      technical scope of a multi-year, multi-million dollar project within the BC Women's Hospital site.</p><p>With the primary 
                      challenge in this project being a tightly constrained budget, it was key that the vast number of technical 
                      pieces was captured and implemented without impact to budget and schedule in remediation.</p><p>
                      The successful execution of the project required the effective coordination of various incoming clinical departments alongside technical specialists, 
                      Project Managers, architects, engineering, construction, telephony, electrical, and cabling companies.

                    Prioritizing the improvement of patient care for those in the most critical clinical states, I managed numerous multi-year
                    demolition and renovation projects of multiple departments within the Richmond Hospital site.</p><p>The primary challenge here was
                    ensuring that the concurrent renovations, all constrained primarily by schedule, were phased iteratively such that 
                    patient care was not impacted while 
                    the work progressed. As with the previous project, various trades groups were managed to accomplish the tasks.</p><p>I was also elected to manage the technical 
                    design and construction of an entire net-new acute care facility within the hospital site.</p>

                    support available.</p><p>The key challenge in this project, beyond ensuring the technical and infrastructure readiness 
                    of the site, was the effective and careful consolidation of various geographically dispersed teams such that 
                    care of at-risk youth was not impacted in any way.

              <div class="intro">
                <p> In a similar initiative, this C-level driven project involved managing the full renovation and retrofit of an entire 
                  site that would drastically improve the care provided for the critically vulnerable Trans members of society.</p><p>
                  Once again the coordination of various trades groups and project managers was key to successfully delivering the most 
                  time-constrained project I have had to date. Full site readiness, including all infrastructure renovation and upgrades, 
                  were required to be completed within less than one month from project initiation.</p><p>This project also
                  involved the added complexity of planning and consolidating various geographically dispersed teams into a single clinic.

                  drastic level of unknown factors in the scope of the project, due to no existing database adequately capturing the in-scope assets. 
                  As such, the coordination of IBM in the deployment and testing of several thousand devices had to be managed 
                  with extreme caution and rigour.</p><p>A very intricate phased approach was used, alongside ensuring the availability of a strong technical support 
                  system to remediate issues that arose post-migration.

                    deployment of an analytics system that helped map when and how overdoses were occurring, which was key in determining 
                    where to position first-response staff. This continues to be crucial in actively preventing increases in mortality rates.
