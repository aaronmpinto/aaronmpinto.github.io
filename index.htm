                  for the entire province by managing a multi-year assessment and
                  transition of over $21M in assets from various Health Authorities to being managed directly by the

                    Services group and the BC Corrections Mental Health group.</p><p>As these departments existed under
                    two distinctly separate Ministries in the province, Health and Corrections, finesse was needed to ensure that the site infrastructure for the merged group would 
                    effectively support and foster the executive leadership consolidation such that patient care would benefit overall.

                      challenge in this project being a tightly constrained budget, it was key that the vast number of technical

                    demolition and renovation projects of multiple departments within the Richmond Hospital site.</p><p>The primary challenge here was
                    ensuring that the concurrent renovations, all constrained primarily by schedule, were phased iteratively such that 
                    patient care was not impacted while

                  drastic level of unknown present in the scope of the project, due to no existing database capturing the in-scope assets. 
                  As such, the coordination of IBM in completion of the deployment and testing of several thousand devices had to be managed

                <p>Once the Fentanyl overdose mortality rate crossed before unthought of thresholds, I was elected to help manage this crisis
                  from an infrastructure perspective.</p><p>Certainly, the primary challenge faced here was the critical timeline as fatalities were
                  occurring at a shocking level each day.</p><p>I first retrofitted key clinics within the heart of where the highest rates of mortality
                  were occurring, to convert them into safe-injection sites where substance users could be managed more directly and where first
                  response could be provided immediately. This has had a lasting impact in lowering mortality rates.</p>

                  <p>At the peak of the crisis, I was tasked with deploying a province-wide solution that would be able to effectively manage the
                    crisis more proactively by identifying where first responders would be needed most prior to overdoses occurring.</p><p>Similarly 
                    in this project, project timelines were the most critical piece.</p><p>I managed the infrastructure portion of a province-wide technical 
                    deployment of an analytics system that helped map when and how overdoses were occurring, which was key in determining 
                    where to position first-response staff. This continues to be key in actively stopping the increase in mortality rates.

                <p>I have understood that a key aspect of creating a better world for all involves providing key support from
                  a completely voluntary perspective.</p><p>As a Board Member, Venue and Events Manager, or in a variety of other 
                  capacities, giving in this manner has proven to provide skills, modesty, wisdom, and
                  passion that have been able to fuel the desire for change in any conditions, working with any groups of people,
                  and to do so for the greater good of all.</p><p>Creating better lives for others may not have a personal financial reward and that 
                  will never be an issue in achieving my Vision and Mission.
